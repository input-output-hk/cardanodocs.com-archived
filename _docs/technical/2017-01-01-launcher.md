# Cardano SL Launcher

## Overview

An executable [`cardano-launcher`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/cardano-sl.cabal#L1074) is a tool for launching Cardano SL. It actually runs the whole Cardano SL system (i.e. a node, a wallet) and handles updates.

You can run it with `--help` flag to see this usage info:

~~~
$ cardano-launcher --help
Usage: cardano-launcher --node PATH [-n ARG] [--node-log PATH] [--wallet PATH]
                        [-w ARG] --updater PATH [-u ARG] [--update-archive PATH]
                        --node-timeout SEC [--report-server URL]
  Tool to launch Cardano SL

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  --node PATH              Path to the node executable
  -n ARG                   An argument to be passed to the node
  --node-log PATH          Path to the log where node's output will be dumped
  --wallet PATH            Path to the wallet executable
  -w ARG                   An argument to be passed to the wallet
  --updater PATH           Path to the updater executable
  -u ARG                   An argument to be passed to the updater
  --update-archive PATH    Path to the update archive (will be passed to the
                           updater)
  --node-timeout SEC       Amount of time to wait for the node to exit before killing it
  --report-server URL      Where to send logs in case of failure
~~~

For example (run via `stack`):

~~~
$ stack exec cardano-launcher --                     \
    --node /tmp/blah-v000/node                       \
    --node-timeout 5                                 \
    --updater /bin/cardano-updater -u dir -u /tmp/n  \
    --update-archive /tmp/cardano-update.tar
~~~

`cardano-node` is a [node application](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/cardano-sl.cabal#L572).

`cardano-updater` is a [separate application](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-updater) for the node updates (see an explanation [below](#updater)). Arguments `-u` and `--update-archive` will be passed to the updater. Please note that `cardano-updater` is not the only updater allowed, so arguments `-u` and `--update-archive` may appear unnecessary.

Node timeout is explained [below](#desktop-scenario).

## Scenarios

There are two work scenarios for `cardano-launcher`: desktop and server. If you provide a path to the wallet (e.g. Daedalus) using `--wallet` argument during start, `cardano-node` will run in [desktop](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L108) scenario, otherwise it will run in [server](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L103) one.

### Server Scenario

After the start, there are 2 steps:

1. Running an updater.
2. Running a node.

Updater's work is explained [below](#updater).

A node is [spawning as a separate process](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L219). After that we just [wait until the node stops](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L129). After a node exits, its exit code is checked. If it equals `20`, we [restart the launcher](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L132), otherwise we quit.

Log info can be written to the log file before quitting. To do it, we must provide two additional arguments during launcher's start: `--report-server` and `--node-log`. The first argument defines an URL of the report server, the second one defines a path to the log file. We asynchronously send log info to the report server [via `POST`-request](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L242). Please note that the file from the `--node-log` argument must exist.

### Desktop Scenario

As the process starts, there are 3 steps:

1. Running an updater.
2. Running a node.
3. Running a wallet.

For steps 1 and 2, see [Server Scenario](#server-scenario) above.

The wallet is [spawning as a separate process](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L155).

After that, we [wait until node or wallet stops](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L156). When it stops, we check it:

1. If the node exits, we write a log (see [Server Scenario](#server-scenario) above for explanations) and  [wait for the wallet death](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L163).
2. If the wallet exits, we check the exit code, and if it equals `20`, we [kill the node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L170) and [restart the launcher in the desktop scenario](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L172). Please note that killing the node isn't executed immediately; the node is killed after some timeout, and its value is obtained from the `--node-timeout` argument mentioned above.
3. If the wallet exits _and_ exit code isn't equal to `20`, we [kill the node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L178) immediately.

## Updater

Another important thing `cardano-launcher` does is updating a node. The first step in both scenarios is [running an updater](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L183). Please note that if the executable file in the `--updater` argument doesn't exist, updating will be [skipped](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L187).

The core idea is very simple. The node update is a special `.tar`-archive: it represents the _difference_ between the old (current) version of the node and a new version of it. A path to this archive is obtained via `--update-archive` argument. So, `cardano-updater` applies this archive to the node, and after restart a new version of the node can be used.

Please note that when we run `cardano-launcher` in desktop scenario, a wallet's user is able to see that an update is ready, and there are two situations possible.

If a user _agrees_ to apply this update, the wallet exits immediately with an exit code `20`. In this case, as described above, launcher restarts the node and the update is applied.

If a user _doesn't agree_ to apply this update, the wallet continues working. But when it _is_ restarted (sooner or later), that update _will_ be applied.

Important: the updater runs synchronously, we start it and then wait for it to finish. If the updater finishes its work [successfully](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L194), the`.tar`-archive is deleted.
